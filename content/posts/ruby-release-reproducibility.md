## Unpinned deps

tool/config.{guess,sub}

## Hidden Dependencies

Running ruby version (codegen) 
Running rubygems version (serialized gemspecs)
GZip default compression level

## Ideas

* Only ship vendored .gems, have installer unpack them
* Don't ship `./configure` scripts, they need to be generated by users machine anyway
* Remove `aclocal.m4` from `realclean-srcs-local` (it is checked in)
* Should be able to re-package from release tarball into identical tarball
* What tests cover the built dist then being installable?
